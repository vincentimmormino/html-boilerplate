    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>I've learned some new things today. All my prior coding experience was me
        self-teaching to make a neocities page, so I wasn't learning the best practices
        for web development.

    <p>
        You heard it here first, folks. I'm haunted by the ghost of a young Victorian
        orphan boy. It's not all bad, though. We're slowly overcoming our differences
        and learning to get along. I taught him how to dougie. Things are looking up
        for us.
