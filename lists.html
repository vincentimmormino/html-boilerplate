        <h2>What's Bozo Like?</h2>
        <p>
            Oh, you want to know more about me? You want to know some things that actually
            matter? Absolutely not. The horrors that haunt my psyche are an enigma. You
            can know some places I'd love to visit, though.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Italy</li>
            <li>France</li>
            <li>Greece</li>
            <li>I'm running out of ideas. I'd like to travel most places.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Games Does Bozo Love?</h2>
        <p>
            You've opened a fucking can of worms, dude. You're lucky I have the willpower
            to not make every item on this list a different Pokemon game. I'll be going
            by franchise instead.
        </p>

            <li>Pokemon (duh.)</li>
